Its possible to subclass a singleton class by making the constructor protected instead of private. 
It might be suitable under some circumstances. An approach taken in these scenarios is to 
create a register of singletons of the subclasses and the getInstance method can take in a
parameter or use an environment variable to return the desired singleton. 
The registry maintains a mapping of string names to singleton objects.
