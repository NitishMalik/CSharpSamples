A builder pattern encapsulates or hides the process of building a complex object and 
separates the representation of the object and its construction. The separation allows us 
to construct different representations using the same construction process. Different representations 
implies creating objects of different classes that may share the same construction process.


The builder pattern might seem similar to the abstract factory pattern but one difference 
is that the builder pattern creates an object step by step whereas 
the abstract factory pattern returns the object in one go.
